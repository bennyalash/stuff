      <div class="rules-section">
        <h2>Card Clarifications</h2>
        <div class="rules-item">
          <p>Dog: The Wolf can kill the Dog. Once the Dog is dead, your other animals can also be killed.</p>
          <p>Goat: You decide which plant to destroy after rolling the die. Example: You roll a die and get a 5. You can now destroy any player's, including your own, Cabbage, Carrot, Corn, or Onion. If you do destroy a plant and only if you do, gain 1 Food.</p>
          <p>Fox: You cannot copy one of your own animals. You must do exactly as the card you are copying says., for example: Copying the Pig - If you choose the second option of placing 1 Food on the Pig, you either can put the Food on a Pig that you have or on an opponent’s pig, but you cannot put Food on the Fox. Only copy the part of the ability that is not italicized, for example if you copy the Horse, ignore the italics about opponents’s dice rolls.
</p>
          <p>Pig: The pig is the only exception to rule B.2. In the specific case where there is not enough food in the bank after killing the Pig, you do not take additional food from another player, even if there isn't enough for you.
</p>
          <p>Horse: All rolls for every opponent are now 1 less. This includes the Goat, Wolf, and Cow.
</p>
          <p>Wolf: You decide which animal to destroy after rolling the die. Example: You roll a die and get a 6. You can now destroy any player's animal, including your own, Cat, Chicken, Raccoon, Dog, Goat, Fox, or Pig (Assuming there is not a Horse in play). If you do destroy an animal and only if you do, gain 1 Food.</p>
          <p>Cow: If you kill the Cow, by paying 7 Coins, immediately Feed ‘Yer Mama. Move your piece up one step and also move the How Much Mama Eats counter up one step.
